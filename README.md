✨Give  me a star if love this project✨

-  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OFawLHRyc-i948H3ZaW0UJbNElZbRrXw?usp=sharing)

Linear programming is a set of techniques used in mathematical programming, sometimes called mathematical optimization, to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities while maximizing or minimizing some linear function. It’s important in fields like scientific computing, economics, technical sciences, manufacturing, transportation, military, management, energy, and so on.

The Python ecosystem offers several comprehensive and powerful tools for linear programming. You can choose between simple and complex tools as well as between free and commercial ones. It all depends on your needs.

With is repository you can do
- Solve LLP problems with two constraints and one objective function
- Get a plot with answer
- ✨Get Real World Exploration✨

## Features

- Easy to run
- Available on Colab
- Get an accurate graph with feasible area

## Example 


## Tech

Libraries used in this code:

- [pulp] - PuLP is an LP modeler written in python.
- [matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- [numpy] - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 


## Installation
![download](https://github.com/sujithrex/Linear_Programming/assets/40714536/02e13316-25ff-40d7-bfd4-96c3315bbd73)

It requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`Change the Variables 
```sh
#variables

Min = False
Max = True


# Define the objective function
x0,y0 = 3,4



#First constraint
x1,y1 = 1,1
# >= means
ls1 = None
#<= means 
gs1 =450



#Second constraint
x2,y2=2,1
# >= means
ls2 = None
#<= means 
gs2 =600
